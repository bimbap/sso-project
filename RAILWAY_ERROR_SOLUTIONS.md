# Railway Deployment Error Solutions

## Current Error Analysis

The error you're experiencing:
```
failed to push production-asia-southeast1-eqsg3a.railway-registry.com
500 Internal Server Error
```

This indicates Railway's container registry in the Asia-Southeast region is experiencing infrastructure issues.

## Immediate Solutions

### Solution 1: Retry with Optimized Dockerfile âœ…
Your Dockerfile has been optimized with:
- Specific PHP version (8.2.12-apache-bullseye)
- Better layer caching
- Pinned Composer version
- Reduced image size

### Solution 2: Clear Build Cache
```cmd
railway build --clear-cache
railway up
```

### Solution 3: Use Legacy Build System
```cmd
railway variables set DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
railway up
```

### Solution 4: Wait and Retry
Railway registry issues are often temporary. Wait 10-15 minutes and retry.

### Solution 5: Alternative Build Strategy
```cmd
# Force clean rebuild
railway service --clean
railway up --detach
```

## Long-term Solutions

### Option A: Nixpacks (Recommended)
Instead of Docker, use Railway's Nixpacks:

1. Delete/rename Dockerfile temporarily:
```cmd
ren Dockerfile Dockerfile.backup
```

2. Create nixpacks.toml:
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['php82', 'php82Packages.composer', 'nodejs', 'sqlite']

[phases.build]
cmds = [
  'composer install --optimize-autoloader --no-dev',
  'php artisan config:cache',
  'php artisan route:cache',
  'php artisan view:cache'
]

[start]
cmd = 'php artisan serve --host=0.0.0.0 --port=$PORT'
```

3. Deploy:
```cmd
railway up
```

### Option B: Alternative Docker Registry
Use Docker Hub as intermediate:

1. Build locally:
```cmd
docker build -t your-username/sso-project .
docker push your-username/sso-project
```

2. Update Dockerfile to use your image:
```dockerfile
FROM your-username/sso-project
# Minimal Railway-specific changes
```

## Monitoring and Status

- **Railway Status**: https://status.railway.app
- **Check Logs**: `railway logs`
- **Build Status**: `railway ps`

## Quick Fix Script

Run the troubleshooting script:
```cmd
fix-railway-error.bat
```

This script will automatically try multiple solutions in sequence.

## Alternative Deployment Platforms

If Railway continues having issues:

### Render.com
- Similar pricing and features
- Better stability
- Easy migration

### DigitalOcean App Platform  
- More expensive but very reliable
- Excellent documentation

### Heroku
- Classic choice
- More expensive
- Very stable

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Try Immediate Fix**: Run `fix-railway-error.bat`
2. **If Still Failing**: Switch to Nixpacks (delete Dockerfile, create nixpacks.toml)
3. **If Urgent**: Consider alternative platform temporarily
4. **Monitor**: Check Railway status page for regional issues

The error is likely temporary infrastructure issues with Railway's Asia-Southeast registry.
