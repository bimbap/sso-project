ðŸš€ Additional Variables Needed

I can see you have the basic variables set, but you need these additional ones for the app to work properly:

In Railway Dashboard Variables tab, ADD these:

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=/app/storage/database/database.sqlite
SESSION_DRIVER=file
SESSION_LIFETIME=120
CACHE_DRIVER=file
LOG_CHANNEL=single

Optional but recommended:
SESSION_ENCRYPT=false
SESSION_PATH=/
SESSION_DOMAIN=
